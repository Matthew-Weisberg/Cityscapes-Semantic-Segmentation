# Cityscapes-Semantic-Segmentation
Custom U-Net model trained for semantic segmentation on the cityscapes dataset

The model only uses the 2975 training and 500 validation images that are publicly available on the kaggle website.
The dataset link is the following: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/cityscapes-image-pairs

Version 2:
Currently downsizes the images from 256x256 to 128x128 due to kaggle notebook RAM constraints.
